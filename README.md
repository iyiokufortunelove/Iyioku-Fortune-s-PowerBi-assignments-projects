# Iyioku-Fortune-s-PowerBi-assignments-projects
This is where I started my portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class at University of Ibadan, with Udemy and a personal tutor.

I have learnt how to create pie charts, bar charts, maps, cluster column chart and amongst other data visualisation tools on PowerBi.

## Project Documentation

### Project Overview 
This data analysis project aims to generate insights into the attrition status among employees using the HR data, and map data over the past year. I have analysed the data I received by using relevant parameters to gather enough insight which has allowed me to make an evidence-based decision to tell compelling stories from my data and insights gotten, and to determine the distribution of attrtion from the age of employees in the organization.

### Data Sources
The primary source of data used here is HR data.xlsx and this is was shared by my personal tutor. Although, this data is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as Kaggle, FRED or any other data repository site. 

### Tools Used

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparations, we perform the follolwing action;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling Missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- What is the overall attrition count?
- Which age group migrated the most?
- What department had the highest level of attrition?

### Data Analysis

This is where I included some basic lines of codes or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during the analysis.

-  #### Development Log
This R document records the steps, iterations, and challenges encountered during the R-based data analysis project.

-  #### Troubleshooting Notes
During development, some R commands produced errors due to missing dependencies and file path discrepancies. These have been documented in the R history file for transparency and future debugging.
