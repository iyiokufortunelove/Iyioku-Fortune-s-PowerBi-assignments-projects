This is where I started my portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class at University of Ibadan, with Udemy and a personal tutor.

I have learnt how to create pie charts, map, stacked cluster map and amongst other data visualisation tools on PowerBi.

### Project overview 
This data analysis project aims to generate insights into the attrition status among employees using the HR data, and map data over the past year. I have analysed the data I received by using relevant parameters to gather enough insight which has allowed me to make an evidence-based decision to tell compelling stories from my data and insights gotten and to determine the distribution of attrtion from the age of employees in the organization.
